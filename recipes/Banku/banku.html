    <h4>For Banku</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix Cassava dough with moderate water and strain out the lumps using colander into pot or saucepan.</li>
        <li>After straining into pot, add corn dough, add extra water and mix together using your hands until smooth and slightly
        thick mixture is formed. Add salt to taste</li>
        <li>Under medium heat, place mixture on fire. Stir consistently until the mixture starts to boil.</li>
        <li>Once it begins boiling, use a spatula(Banku <q>ta</q>) to knead the mixture to prevent it from forming lumps.</li>
        <li>Continuously knead the mixture intermittently until it gets smoother and thicker and its colour changes slightly for
        about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Banku is ready when you don&#39;t taste the raw corn dough after eating or you can mash a little of the cooked mixture in a
        little water. If it dissolves and turns milky then your Banku isn&#39;t ready.</li>
        <li>When the Banku is ready, scoop it out and wrap each ball in a plain polythene rubber.</li>
        <li>Banku can be kept for about two-three days in an airtight container or longer period in a fridge</li>
