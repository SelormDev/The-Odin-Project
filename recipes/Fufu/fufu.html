    <h2>Indredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon of peeled, fresh grated ginger (about an inch to 1 1/2 inch)</li>
        <li>2&#8211;3 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground aniseed (sekoni) or other seasoning of your choice</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon of no-salt seasoning of your choice (Iâ€™m using Mrs. Dash garlic and herb; many Ghanaians would likely
        use a couple of seasoning cubes)</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon of ground dried red chili pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste, or substitute seasoning salt)</li>
        <li>2 small bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 whole kpakpo shito, whole, if available and (if not, substitute your choice of pepper(s), top(s) sliced off (about a
        tablespoon), or omit altogether</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the goat meat in a soup pot and season it with the above ingredients. Stir the goat meat well, and add 1/2 cup water
        to the pot. Cover, bring the water to a boil, lower the heat to simmer while you prepare a second pot with:
        <ul>
        <li>4 oz of washed tomatoes, whole (1 large or 2 small-to-medium. I used 4 small Campari)</li>
        <li>4 oz of peeled onion (about 1 medium)</li>
        <li>Fresh whole red chilli peppers to taste (probably 1 to 3, depending on type and heat), tops cut off, and seeded if you
        like</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bring that water to a boil and simmer 10 or 15 minutes until the vegetables are soft, then remove grind them together
        (in a blender or anasanka) and return them to the water in the second pot, along with 4 more cups of water.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, let it simmer a few minutes, and add the broth to the meat. Let the soup simmer
        until the goat meat is tender, then remove the goat meat and, for a nice clear soup, strain the broth through a sieve,
        into the using a spoon if necessary to help force some of the ground vegetables through the sieve (scrape the underside
        of the strainer with a spoon).</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the pot and adjust the seasonings (salt, onion, tomato, pepper, etc.) to taste. This may need to
        simmer for a couple of hours: goat meat tends to be tougher than beef. Add a little more water if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hint: To simplify this recipe, grind the vegetables (tomatoes, onion, pepper) at the beginning and add them to the meat
    pot, along with 8 cups of water. Barbara insists that the best flavor is obtained if you first allow the goat meat to
    simmer for 15 minutes before adding the vegetable broth.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hint: There are many variations of this recipe: you can cook some eggplant or zucchini in a saucepan, then blend and add
    it near the end for a thicker soup; or you can add many other vegetables like okra or mushrooms, or other herbs or
    seasonings.
